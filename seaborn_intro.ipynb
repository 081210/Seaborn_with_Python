    "Seaborn is complimentary to Matplotlib and it specifically targets statistical data visualization. But it goes even further than that: Seaborn extends Matplotlib and that’s why it can address the two biggest frustrations of working with Matplotlib. Or, as Michael Waskom says in the “introduction to Seaborn”: “If matplotlib “tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible”, seaborn tries to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too.”\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these hard things or frustrations had to do with the default Matplotlib parameters. Seaborn works with different parameters, which undoubtedly speaks to those users that don’t use the default looks of the Matplotlib plots."
